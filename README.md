Spotify User Authorization Flow (in Go)

See https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/ for details on User Authorization

This was written for use with the Spotify iOS-SDK but should work with minor or no changes with other setups.

## Installation

1. Enter your Client ID, Client Secret (from your Spotify Developer account) and redirect URL (from your app) directly in the Go file and compile. (the redirect URI only seems to be an extra validation check on the id/secret by Spotify, it's not connected to)

2. Copy/symlink your https key and cert files into the same directory (DER or PEM format seems to work)

3. That's it. Just run it (only argument is the listening port), or put in a systemd unit to have it run detached from a terminal.

## Notes

Access tokens can be generated by either swapping with an access code or using a refresh token.

This should run much faster than any other implementation I've seen and is easier to setup (if you're familiar with Go and Linux). It uses the https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter Go package, which I've really found to be better than the standard Go package, but it's easy enough to remove that dependecy and use the stock router or another one.

See the source code for additional information.
